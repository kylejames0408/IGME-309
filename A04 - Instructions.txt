Usage:
- Press W to select a higher rectangle ID
- Press S to select a lower rectangle ID
- Press A to rotate counter-clockwise
- Press D to rotate clockwise

NOTES (for me):
- I wanted to achieve the tree structure selection style but didn't have time to pursue.
    - Because we could not, the selection process may seem uncoordinated to an average user.
    - Currently selects while moving through the draw order.
- Translations are not stored, but instead hard coded since we aren't dynamically changing them.
- Rotations are stored because we are dynamically changing them.
